# Odin Recipes
### Desription
This is the very first project for the Odin Project! It's a website that displays three selected recipes from Chilean cuisine. 

### Tools used
-Very minimal styling with CSS
<br>
-HTML

### Skills learned
This was a good reminder for me to ensure that relative links function between pages! Also, it was my first time ever committing code with Git, so that was good to learn as well. I can now quickly set up very basic webpages.
